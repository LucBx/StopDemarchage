# StopDemarchage privacy policy

StopDemarchage does call filtering locally on the terminal without collecting any data on the call or terminal activity.

The requested permissions are:

- READ_CONTACTS : it is used to whitelist contacts in the terminal contact list. If this permission is not granted, the application will not screen mobile numbers (but still work for commercial numbers).
